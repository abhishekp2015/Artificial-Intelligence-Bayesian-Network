# Artificial-Intelligence-Bayesian-Network
Platform: Python

   Developed a Bayesian network which may contain several decision nodes and a utility node. Implemented Algorithms to perform following tasks: 
   
   1) Calculate specific Joint probabilities, Marginal probabilities and Conditional probabilities, when there is either no decision node, or the decision node has a set value (for conditional probabilities).  
   2) Calculate the Expected Utility or Maximum Expected Utility, when there are one or more unset Decision nodes.
